      <section id="about">
          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>My name is Fredric Karlsson, and I am studying to become a Fullstack Software Developer (.NET) at Lexicon.
          <p>I am currently seeking an internship for my final 12 weeks, where I can apply my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.</p> 
          <p>My education has provided me with experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL, React, and Entity Framework, along with a deeper understanding of cloud-based solutions thanks to my certification in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900).</p>
          <p>I am a solution-oriented person who enjoys working toward clear goals, whether in a fast-paced or more structured project environment. With a strong interest in technology and a high capacity to adapt quickly to new challenges, I have worked as an IT trainee at New Wave Group, providing IT support in an international team both on-site and remotely. This experience has enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in different environments and handle technical issues systematically.</p>
          <p>Alongside my studies, I have also managed IT solutions like Azure and Office365 for Emmaboda IS, giving me practical experience in implementing and maintaining modern technologies in a community setting. My voluntary involvement in e-sports and board positions has also developed my leadership skills and teamwork abilities, where I have led groups and organized large events.</p>
          <p>I am comfortable working both remotely and on-site, and I am looking for an internship where I can contribute with my technical skills while continuing to grow in system development and cloud technologies.</p>

          <p>Today in school, we focused on CSS,<br><br> which has been really exciting! I took the opportunity to rebuild my entire site to make it feel more personal and unique to me. <br><br> I spent a lot of time adjusting different elements and learning how CSS can transform the look and feel of a page. <br> It’s amazing to see how small changes in styles can make such a big difference. <br><br>Looking forward to experimenting even more and refining the design to better reflect my personality!</p>
