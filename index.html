          <p>Hi! I'm Fredric Karlsson, currently studying to become a Fullstack Software Developer (.NET) at Lexicon. I'm seeking a 12-week internship where I can apply my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
          
          <p>My education has equipped me with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL, React, and Entity Framework. I'm also certified in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), deepening my understanding of cloud-based solutions.</p>
          
          <p>As an IT trainee at New Wave Group, I delivered IT support across an international team both remotely and on-site. This enhanced my problem-solving skills and taught me how to collaborate effectively in various work environments.</p>
          
          <p>In parallel with my studies, I’ve managed IT solutions such as Azure and Office365 for Emmaboda IS. My volunteer leadership experience in e-sports has further developed my ability to lead and work in teams.</p>

        <h2>My School Days</h2>
        <h3>Time Flies with C#</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-13 03:50</p>
            <p>Wow, time really flies when you're having fun! 👌🏻</p>
            <p>I've recently dived deeper into C# (pronounced "C-Sharp") as part of my studies, and I'm happy to report that I'm already getting the hang of it. The most exciting part? My new MacBook Pro has finally arrived, so I feel right at home again in a coding environment. It’s amazing to be back with a familiar setup!</p>
            <h4>Here's a quick rundown of what we’ve covered in school so far:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Hello World"</strong>: The classic starting point! Writing this line in a new language is always a satisfying milestone.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid Layout</strong>: Learning about how to structure applications visually using grid layouts has been interesting. It’s more than just placing items on a screen; it’s about organizing them in a logical, user-friendly way.</li>
                <li><strong>Operators and Expressions</strong>: We’ve been working with the basic building blocks of C#, diving into operators (like +, -, *, /) and expressions to start manipulating data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I’d already done some self-study with C# and .NET, it feels like I’m revisiting familiar territory—almost like a warm-up before the real deep dive begins!</p>
            <p>Today, I also took some time to go through a topic that’s essential for any programmer: <strong>Creating Readable Code with Conventions, Whitespace, and Comments</strong> in C#. It’s so helpful to write code in a way that's not only functional but also clean and understandable. It’s something that’ll definitely come in handy as I start tackling bigger projects.</p>
            <p>Now, it’s time to get some rest so I’m ready to tackle another day of learning tomorrow.</p>

        <h2>My School Days Blog</h2>
        <h3>A Quick Update from My Coding Journey</h3>
        <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-10 14:42</p>
        <p>Hey everyone!</p>
        <p>This post is coming in a bit late, but school doesn't slow down, even on weekends!</p>
        <p>On Friday, we wrapped up a summary of everything we've been working on, including a deep dive into <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> selectors with <code>div</code> in CSS and HTML. I also took some extra time to dive into HTML and CSS through Microsoft Learn, which has been super helpful. Plus, I found some great inspiration and exercises on www.w3schools.com that really helped reinforce what I've been learning.</p>
        <p>Today, I plan to work on adding a collapse function to my resume project, which I’m pretty excited about. It’s a small feature but adds a lot of functionality!</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I'm really pumped for next week because we’re starting with C# (pronounced "C-sharp"). I’ve been looking forward to exploring it, so stay tuned!</p>
        <p>Also, I've been lending a hand to my classmates here and there. I think they appreciate the help, but if I’m being honest, it’s also a bit selfish – helping others is one of the best ways for me to learn too. 😊</p>
        <p>Feel free to check out my resume and let me know what you think! I’d love some feedback.</p>
        <p>Catch you all on Monday, November 11th.</p>
        <p>Best,<br>Fredric</p>

        <h3>Deep Dive Day with HTML, CSS, and Using GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-07 16:10</p>
        <p>Today, our teacher introduced us to using GitHub Pages. In addition, I decided to dive deeper into CSS and HTML. I used w3schools.com to explore different elements and features, as they offer clear explanations along with interactive exercises and quizzes.</p>
        <p>I also revamped the header section and created a footer for the site—another day filled with new skills!</p>
        <p>I’ve only scratched the surface, but I think it’s safe to say I’m officially hooked on coding now.</p>

        <h3><strong>Learning CSS and Personalizing My Website</strong></h3>
        <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-06 14:19</p>
        <p>Today in school, we focused on CSS,<br><br> which has been really exciting! I took the opportunity to rebuild my entire site to make it feel more personal and unique to me. <br><br> I spent a lot of time adjusting different elements and learning how CSS can transform the look and feel of a page. <br> It’s amazing to see how small changes in styles can make such a big difference. <br><br>Looking forward to experimenting even more and refining the design to better reflect my personality!</p>
