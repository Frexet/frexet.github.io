      <section id="about">
          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>My name is Fredric Karlsson, and I am studying to become a Fullstack Software Developer (.NET) at Lexicon.
          <p>I am currently seeking an internship for my final 12 weeks, where I can apply my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.</p> 
          <p>My education has provided me with experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, SQL, React, and Entity Framework, along with a deeper understanding of cloud-based solutions thanks to my certification in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900).</p>
          <p>I am a solution-oriented person who enjoys working toward clear goals, whether in a fast-paced or more structured project environment. With a strong interest in technology and a high capacity to adapt quickly to new challenges, I have worked as an IT trainee at New Wave Group, providing IT support in an international team both on-site and remotely. This experience has enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in different environments and handle technical issues systematically.</p>
          <p>Alongside my studies, I have also managed IT solutions like Azure and Office365 for Emmaboda IS, giving me practical experience in implementing and maintaining modern technologies in a community setting. My voluntary involvement in e-sports and board positions has also developed my leadership skills and teamwork abilities, where I have led groups and organized large events.</p>
          <p>I am comfortable working both remotely and on-site, and I am looking for an internship where I can contribute with my technical skills while continuing to grow in system development and cloud technologies.</p>

      <h2>My School Days Blog</h2>
      <div class="blog-post">Published on: 2024-11-10 14:42</p>
        <h3>A Quick Update from My Coding Journey</h1>
        <p>Hey everyone!</p>
        <p>This post is coming in a bit late, but school doesn't slow down, even on weekends!</p>
        <p>On Friday, we wrapped up a summary of everything we've been working on, including a deep dive into <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> selectors with <code>div</code> in CSS and HTML. I also took some extra time to dive into HTML and CSS through Microsoft Learn, which has been super helpful. Plus, I found some great inspiration and exercises on www.w3schools.com that really helped reinforce what I've been learning.</p>
        <p>Today, I plan to work on adding a collapse function to my resume project, which I’m pretty excited about. It’s a small feature but adds a lot of functionality!</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I'm really pumped for next week because we’re starting with C# (pronounced "C-sharp"). I’ve been looking forward to exploring it, so stay tuned!</p>
        <p>Also, I've been lending a hand to my classmates here and there. I think they appreciate the help, but if I’m being honest, it’s also a bit selfish – helping others is one of the best ways for me to learn too. 😊</p>
        <p>Feel free to check out my resume and let me know what you think! I’d love some feedback.</p>
        <p>Catch you all on Monday, November 11th.</p>
        <p>Best,<br>Fredric</p>

        <h3>Deep Dive Day with HTML, CSS, and Using GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-07 16:10</p>
        <p>Today, our teacher introduced us to using GitHub Pages. In addition, I decided to dive deeper into CSS and HTML. I used w3schools.com to explore different elements and features, as they offer clear explanations along with interactive exercises and quizzes.</p>
        <p>I also revamped the header section and created a footer for the site—another day filled with new skills! I’ve only scratched the surface, but I think it’s safe to say I’m officially hooked on coding now.

          <h3><strong>Learning CSS and Personalizing My Website</strong></h3>
          <p class="date">Published on: 2024-11-06 14:19</p>
          <p>Today in school, we focused on CSS,<br><br> which has been really exciting! I took the opportunity to rebuild my entire site to make it feel more personal and unique to me. <br><br> I spent a lot of time adjusting different elements and learning how CSS can transform the look and feel of a page. <br> It’s amazing to see how small changes in styles can make such a big difference. <br><br>Looking forward to experimenting even more and refining the design to better reflect my personality!</p>
